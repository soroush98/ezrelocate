"""The unified listing record every source normalizes into.

This is the actor's public contract — the shape pushed to the Apify dataset.
It mirrors EZrelocate's `ScrapedListing` (backend/etl/_scrape.py) so the two
stay interchangeable, plus a few fields that only make sense for a published
dataset (`source`, `scraped_at`, cross-source dedup metadata, amenity distances).
